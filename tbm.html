    <h1>Animation was Amazing!</h1>
    <p>I enjoyed my creature from my last project that I decided to keep using it! It was incredibly fun doing this project. It was time consuming but worth it! Playing with time and sound was a new experience for me and will really help me in my journey to come! For some reason the airplane sound is missing! Just imagine it is there!</p>
